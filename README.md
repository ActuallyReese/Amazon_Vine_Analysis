## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### The purpose of the analysis is to compare reviews between normal customers and those in the Amazon Vine program in order to determine if the Vine program contributes to a bias in reviews.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
  - How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
### There does appear to be a bias toward 5 star reviews for reviews from Vine members. The number of Vine members is very small, however, which could be leading to a misleading analysis
### An additional analysis I would perform would be to see the number of reviews for every star rating, to see if Vine members were also less likely to give a bad review.
